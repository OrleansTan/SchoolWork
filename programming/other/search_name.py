# Write and submit a program, search_name.py, which demonstrates the following:
# • Read a target name and a list of names separated by commas.
# • Iterate with for to search for the target (case-insensitive).
# • Use break when the target is found and report its index.
# • If not found, print not found.
# • Trim whitespace around names when splitting input.
# • Ensure exactly one labelled line of output.
# • Keep the script under 50 lines.
# • Test with duplicates and mixed cases.
